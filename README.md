# StringAlgorithms

Each algorithm has its own main function with some basic examples. 
All algorithms execpt aho-corasick take only the text and the pattern as input and can be used individually.

The testing class is able to run some or all the algorithms on the same input data, with matplotlib its even possible to create plots.
