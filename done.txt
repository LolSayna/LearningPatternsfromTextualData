KMP:
-naive implementation
-regular implementation+nextTable

-testing: single run with timing, multiple runs and comparing results, generating random valid input

-problems: naive implementation and string "aaaa", with pattern "aa" 
    kmp matches, where the algo continues
    kmp with leading zero

AhoC:


-problems: string.ascii_uppercase + string.digits as possible chars
    how many states, for now using upper limit and some are empty -> trie
    implementation of goTo function, whole alphabet vs hashing/dict
    checking on input-> multiple times the same word
